/// to a target, the previous binding for that target is automatically broken.
///
/// Buffer object names are unsigned integers. The value zero is reserved, but there is no default
/// buffer object for each buffer object target. Instead, `buffer` set to zero effectively unbinds
/// any buffer object previously bound, and restores client memory usage for that buffer object target
